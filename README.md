# Food-Ordering-System for Restaurant


An intelligent voice-based food ordering system that allows users to place orders using natural language speech. The system converts speech to text in real-time, matches user intent with menu items using NLP techniques, and generates an order summary with pricing.

---

## 🚀 Features
*🎤 Real-time Speech-to-Text: High-accuracy voice capture using the Web Speech API.
*🧠 Semantic Item Matching: Powered by Sentence Transformers and FAISS for smart menu searches.
*🔢 Intelligent Extraction: Advanced Regex logic to identify quantities and item variants (e.g., "three farmhouse pizzas").
*🖥️ Professional Dashboard: A clean, centered, and responsive UI for real-time order tracking.
*⚡ Async Backend: Built with FastAPI for ultra-fast processing and low-latency responses.
*📑 Automatic Billing: Real-time generation of order summaries with precise price calculations.
